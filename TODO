19: gethostbyname on win32
--------------------------
net6 should use gethostbyname instead of getaddrinfo for the win32 
implementation because getaddrinfo seem only to exist in Windows XP's 
version of ws2_32.dll.

24: Bug: User attribution copied when using copy & paste
--------------------------------------------------------
If somebody copies some text of another user on the host and pastes it then 
it will show up temporarily as own text, but it will get the other user's 
colour after the next redraw.

2: Improve the network handling on Win32
----------------------------------------
Opening large documents is ''really'' slow on the timer implementation in 
use on Win32. Currently the connection is polled every 400ms, which is 
certainly not optimal.

17: Implement support for Zeroconf
----------------------------------
''Zeroconf'' (also known as Apple Bonjour) is a technology to discover 
local network services. The Gobby host may announce itself as a network 
service which could be browsed by other clients on the local subnet. The 
listing and delisting is implemented with the use of multicast DNS and 
happens automatically. ''libobby'' contains an abstraction to the ''howl'' 
implementation of this protocol.

 * We need to add a linking exception for ''howl'' to ''libobby'' (#18).
 * We need a UI implementation of ''Zeroconf'' within ''Gobby's '' join 
dialog.
 * We need proper integration into the GUI main loop on Linux (possibly 
eliminating the necessity to start mDNSResponder prior to a ''howl'' using 
application).

21: Provide some means of authentication
----------------------------------------
''libobby'' should provide some means of authentication. There should be 
several possibilities of authentication schemes (maybe this ticket should 
be splitted when they are getting implemented one-by-one):

 * If a user logs in the first time since the host restarted a password 
specified by the user will be set on the server with which it could 
authenticate itself after a connection loss.
 * A simple global password is need to login into a server, known to all 
users of it.
 * The server checks a user/password combination against a user database, 
useful for dedicated private ''obby'' servers.
 * Single documents could be get some kind of password or access control 
list protection, but #10 has to be implemented first.

25: A flag specifing if a document has changed
----------------------------------------------
A flag should be implemented which specifies if the document has changed 
since the last save. It should be reset when it is saved to disk and 
changed as soon as the first change (local and non-local) is received and 
put into the text buffer.

26: Request confirmations for unsaved documents
-----------------------------------------------
Gobby should request a confirmation if you want to quit it and still have 
unsaved documents (#25) open in the session. 

27: Switch to tabs newly opened
-------------------------------
The current selected document should be changed to the one newly opened 
when loading one from a file.

16: Error code transmission
---------------------------
We should transmit error codes instead of error strings in net6. The client 
may build a (localised, see #14) string out of it.
