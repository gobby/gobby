### How to report bugs

Bugs should be files as issues on the github issue tracker at
<https://github.com/gobby/gobby/issues>. 

### How to get involved

We urgently seek all kind of people who could help us in any
way. Firstly we need documentation writers who could help us
crafting a help file and some standalone documentation for the
web. Secondly, if you are skilled in C/C++ programming, we could
need helping hands with programming. A starting point could be
[github issues](https://github.com/gobby/gobby.git).
And last, but certainly not least, we need translators
who get their hands at Gobby's string templates to get it
localised. Thus more could use Gobby in their native language.
Just contact us, if in doubt, for more details.

There are also two mailing lists which should provide a mean
of contact to other Gobby users and to the developers.

  releases of Gobby and its foundation, libinfinity. To subscribe,
